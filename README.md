# 21-card-game
Hello everybody.
This is again pretty simple game. This time its a card game called 21
Basically what you doing is you are playing agiains the bank and tries to win banks money.
You make a bet and then you take card and try to score 21. If you score less then 21 or 21 bank is play its card 
and tries to do the same -> win. If you score more than 21 you lose. (you score by taking cards);
Well, the rules of 21 card game is of course kind of complicated and i would want to explain them all here, so if
you really interested in this game youd rather go and watch some video or read the rules.
From a coding stand point i tried to use some oop princples and even whats at this point think is a pattern called strategy.
i am probalby wrong but i thing my class called CountScore does it.
